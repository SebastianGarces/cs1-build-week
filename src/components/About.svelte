		In late 1940, John von Neumann defined life as a creation (as a being or
		organism) which can reproduce itself and simulate a Turing machine. Von
		Neumann was thinking about an engineering solution which would use
		electromagnetic components floating randomly in liquid or gas.[2] This
		turned out not to be realistic with the technology available at the
		time. Stanislaw Ulam invented cellular automata, which were intended to
		simulate von Neumann's theoretical electromagnetic constructions. Ulam
		discussed using computers to simulate his cellular automata in a
		two-dimensional lattice in several papers. In parallel, von Neumann
		attempted to construct Ulam's cellular automaton.

		Motivated by questions in mathematical logic and in part by work on
		simulation games by Ulam, among others, John Conway began doing
		experiments in 1968 with a variety of different two-dimensional cellular
		automaton rules.[3] Conway's initial goal was to define an interesting
		and unpredictable cell automaton. For example, he wanted some
		configurations to last for a long time before dying and other
		configurations to go on forever without allowing cycles. It was a
		significant challenge and an open problem for years before experts on
		cellular automata managed to prove that, indeed, the Game of Life
		admitted of a configuration which was alive in the sense of satisfying
		Von Neumann's two general requirements. While the definitions before the
		Game of Life were proof-oriented, Conway's construction aimed at
		simplicity without a priori providing proof the automaton was alive.
